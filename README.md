This is the repostory for the 2026 edition of the Europlanet GMAP winter School. This year the school will be focused on planetary exploration, as a tribute to our dear colleague Riccardo Pozzobon.

Here you will find basic guides about planetary mapping, how to use QGIS, and information about the hands-on you will do this year.

For basic information about the school, liek registration, schedule, and times, please reach the main webpage:
