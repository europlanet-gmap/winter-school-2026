## The Moon: hands-on short guide

Important: If you are a Mac user, please set the crs of your QGIS project to ESRI:103881 before mapping, since sometimes your QGIS might not do it automatically.

Overview: This exercise involves a workflow to do a complete landing site assessment analysis of the study area located within Mare Ingenii, one of the few lunar mare features on the far side. It is characterized by the presence of a pit and of lunar swirls. 

## Hands-on objectives

Landing site characterization

## Data required

Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) from LROC; Clementine spectral data; LOLA-Kaguya Global DEM and a high-resolution NAC-derived DEM.

## Steps involved

Creation of the study area; generation of a grid for landing-ellipse placement; computation of DEM-derived statistical parameters for each grid tile; placement of landing ellipses; generation of traverses; and computation of elevation and slope profiles for each traverse. 

## Expected results

Use of engineering constraints to identify and enable safer exploration strategies on the lunar surface.

## The Moon: task short guide

## Task objectives

Creation of several traverses in order to safely explore the Mare Ingenii pit and the swirls.

## Data required

Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) from LROC; Clementine spectral data; LOLA-Kaguya Global DEM and a high-resolution NAC-derived DEM.

## Steps involved

Creation of the study area; generation of a grid for landing-ellipse placement; computation of DEM-derived statistical parameters for each grid tile; placement of landing ellipses; generation of traverses; and computation of elevation and slope profiles for each traverse. 

## Expected results

A table summarizing DEM-derived statistical parameters for each landing ellipse, along with elevation and slope profiles for each traverse.
