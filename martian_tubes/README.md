## Caves and Tubes on Mars: mapping Hands on

Overview: This exercise involves a workflow to perform a morphometric  assessment of Martian pit chains potentially associated to lava tube caves. Morphometry is an important tool to understand genetic processes and scale relationship with terrestrial analogues.

## Hands-on objectives

Obtain a morphometry dataste from a pit chain whose characteristics suggest a lava tube origin and the potential presence of intact segments of a lava tube conduit. 

## Data required

CTX images of the southern flank of Arsia Mons, MOLA DEM, polygon and polyline shapefiles for editing

## Steps involved

Analysis of pit chain and lava flow morphology; creation of profile sections along the chains to evaluate constraints; identification of “visible” lava tube segments  (collapsed or channelized) and “inferred” lava tube path (probable intact tube segments); definition of polygons for each pit, with categorization; creation of bounding boxes to extract major and minor axis of the pits; comparison of the obtained dataset with other Martian and terrestrial examples

## Expected results

Use of morphometry to define the potential extension and volume of the intact tube below the surface
